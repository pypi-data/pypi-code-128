    This can be used to listen for the start of content, or for bleeps and
    bloops when navigating the UI. It returns after the first significant
    volume change. This function tries hard to give accurate timestamps for
    when the volume changed. It works best for sudden changes like a beep.

    This function detects changes in volume using a rolling window. The RMS
    volume is calculated over a rolling window of size ``window_size_secs``.
    For every sample this function compares the RMS volume in the window
    preceeding the sample, to the RMS volume in the window following the
    sample. The ratio of the two volumes determines whether the volume change
    is significant or not.

    :param window_size_secs: The time over which the RMS volume should be

        detect bleeps shorter than 400ms duration.

    :param threshold_db: This controls sensitivity to volume changes. A volume
        change is considered significant if the ratio between the volume before

        ``threshold_db=10`` (the default) and
        ``direction=VolumeChangeDirection.LOUDER`` the RMS volume must increase
        by 10 dB (a factor of 3.16 in amplitude). With
        ``direction=VolumeChangeDirection.QUIETER`` the RMS volume must fall by
        10 dB.

    :type noise_floor_amplitude: float
    :param noise_floor_amplitude: This is used to avoid `ZeroDivisionError`
        exceptions.  The change from an amplitude of 0 to 0.1 is ∞ dB.

        this non-zero value instead. It defaults to ~0.0003 (-70dBov). Increase
        this value if there is some sort of background noise that you want to
        ignore.

    :type timeout_secs: float
    :param timeout_secs: Timeout in seconds. If no significant volume change is
        found within this time, `VolumeChangeTimeout` will be raised and your
        test will fail.

    class's ``is_visible`` property) as well as finding the selection.

    For example, to find the selection of an on-screen keyboard, ``image``
    would be a screenshot of the keyboard without any selection. You may need

    This function tries each of the Page Objects defined in your test-pack
    (that is, subclasses of `stbt.FrameObject`) and returns an instance of
    each Page Object that is visible (according to the object's ``is_visible``
    property).

    This is a Python `generator`_ that yields 1 Page Object at a time. If your
    code only consumes the first object (like in the example below),
    ``detect_pages`` will try each Page Object class until it finds a match,
    yield it to your code, and then it won't waste time trying other Page
    Object classes::

        page = next(stbt.detect_pages())

    To get all the matching pages you can iterate like this::

        for page in stbt.detect_pages():
            print(type(page))

    Or create a list like this::

        pages = list(stbt.detect_pages())

    :param stbt.Frame frame:
        The video frame to process; if not specified, a new frame is grabbed
        from the device-under-test by calling `stbt.get_frame`.

    :param Sequence[Type[stbt.FrameObject]] candidates:
        The Page Object classes to try. Note that this is a list of the classes
        themselves, not instances of those classes. If ``candidates`` isn't
        specified, ``detect_pages`` will use static analysis to find all of the
        Page Objects defined in your test-pack.

    :param str test_pack_root:
        A subdirectory of your test-pack to search for Page Object definitions,
        used when ``candidates`` isn't specified. Defaults to the entire
        test-pack.

    :rtype: Iterator[stbt.FrameObject]
    :returns:
        An iterator of Page Object instances that match the given ``frame``.

    This uses an adaptive threshold algorithm to binarize the image into
    foreground vs. background pixels. For finer control, you can do the
    binarization yourself (for example with `stbt.color_diff`) and pass the

    :param Frame frame:
      The video-frame or image to process.

    :param int steps:
      Do another segmentation within each region found in the previous step,
      altering direction between VERTICAL and HORIZONTAL each step. For
      example, the default values
      ``steps=1, initial_direction=stbt.Direction.VERTICAL`` will find lines of
      text; ``steps=2`` will recursively perform segmentation horizontally
      within each line to find each character in the line (assuming the
      characters don't overlap due to kerning; overlapping characters will be
      segmented as a single region).

    :param bool narrow:
      At the last step, narrow each region in the opposite direction. For
      example: if you are segmenting lines of text with
      ``steps=1, initial_direction=stbt.Direction.VERTICAL, narrow=False`` you
      will get regions with ``y`` & ``bottom`` matching the top & bottom of
      each line, but with ``x`` & ``right`` set to the left & right edges of
      the frame (0 and the frame's width, respectively). With ``narrow=True``,
      each region's ``x`` & ``right`` will be the leftmost / rightmost edge of
      the line.

    :param bool light_background:

      black text on a light background).
