    'long_description': '# Volume Segmantics\n\nA toolkit for semantic segmentation of volumetric data using PyTorch deep learning models.\n\n![example workflow](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/volume-segmantics/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg) ![example workflow](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/volume-segmantics/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)\n\nGiven a 3d image volume and corresponding dense labels (the segmentation), a 2d model is trained on image slices taken along the x, y, and z axes. The method is optimised for small training datasets, e.g a single dataset in between $128^3$ and $512^3$ pixels. To achieve this, all models use pre-trained encoders and image augmentations are used to expand the size of the training dataset.\n\nThis work utilises the abilities afforded by the excellent [segmentation-models-pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) library in combination with augmentations made available via [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/). Also the metrics and loss functions used make use of the hard work done by Adrian Wolny in his [pytorch-3dunet](https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet) repository. \n\n## Requirements\n\nA machine capable of running CUDA enabled PyTorch version 1.7.1 or greater is required. This generally means a reasonably modern NVIDIA GPU. The exact requirements differ according to operating system. For example on Windows you will need Visual Studio Build Tools as well as CUDA Toolkit installed see [the CUDA docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) for more details. \n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install the package is to first create a new conda environment or virtualenv with python (ideally >= version 3.8) and also pip, then activate the environment and `pip install volume-segmantics`. If a CUDA-enabled build of PyTorch is not being installed by pip, you can try `pip install volume-segmantics --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl` this particularity seems to be an issue on Windows. \n\n## Configuration and command line use\n\nAfter installation, two new commands will be available from your terminal whilst your environment is activated, `model-train-2d` and `model-predict-2d`.\n\nThese commands require access to some settings stored in YAML files. These need to be located in a directory named `volseg-settings` within the directory where you are running the commands. The settings files can be copied from [here](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/volume-segmantics/releases/download/v0.2.5/volseg-settings.zip). \n\nThe file `2d_model_train_settings.yaml` can be edited in order to change training parameters such as number of epochs, loss functions, evaluation metrics and also model and encoder architectures. The file `2d_model_predict_settings.yaml` can be edited to change parameters such as the prediction "quality" e.g "low" quality refers to prediction of the volume segmentation by taking images along a single axis (images in the (x,y) plane). For "medium" and "high" quality, predictions are done along 3 axes and in 12 directions (3 axes, 4 rotations) respectively, before being combined by maximum probability. \n\n### For training a 2d model on a 3d image volume and corresponding labels\nRun the following command. Input files can be in HDF5 or multi-page TIFF format.\n\n```shell\nmodel-train-2d --data path/to/image/data.h5 --labels path/to/corresponding/segmentation/labels.h5\n```\n\nPaths to multiple data and label volumes can be added after the `--data` and `--labels` flags respectively. A model will be trained according to the settings defined in `/volseg-settings/2d_model_train_settings.yaml` and saved to your working directory. In addition, a figure showing "ground truth" segmentation vs model segmentation for some images in the validation set will be saved. \n\n##### For 3d volume segmentation prediction using a 2d model\nRun the following command. Input image files can be in HDF5 or multi-page TIFF format.\n\n```shell\nmodel-predict-2d path/to/model_file.pytorch path/to/data_for_prediction.h5\n```\n\nThe input data will be segmented using the input model following the settings specified in `volseg-settings/2d_model_predict_settings.yaml`. An HDF5 file containing the segmented volume will be saved to your working directory.\n\n## Using the API\n\nYou can use the functionality of the package in your own program via the API, this is [documented here](https://diamondlightsource.github.io/volume-segmantics/). This interface is the one used by [SuRVoS2](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/SuRVoS2), a client/server GUI application that allows fast annotation and segmentation of volumetric data. \n\n## References\n\n**Albumentations**\n\nBuslaev, A., Iglovikov, V.I., Khvedchenya, E., Parinov, A., Druzhinin, M., and Kalinin, A.A.
